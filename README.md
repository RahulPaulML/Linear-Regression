# Resturant-Profit-Maximization

This project computes the city that a resturant might want to invest in opening an outlet from the data collected by their food trucks across different cities. The data collected is the population of the cities and the respective profits of the food truck in those cities. Linear Regression has been used to analyse and compute the name of the city the CEO of the resturant company should open their outlet in.
